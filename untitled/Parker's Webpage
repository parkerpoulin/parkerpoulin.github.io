<h2>Freshman student at the University of Maine.</h2>


<p><i>Hi guys</i>, <b>thanks for visiting <i>my</i> web page</b>. This is a site telling a little bit about my self for BUA 235. I live in Oakland, Maine and I am probably one of the biggest sports fans you will ever meet. I have two sisters and I am the middle child, my family over all is very big as my dad has 10 brothers and sisters on his side. I am an accounting and finance major and am a big fan of analyzing companies, looking at the stock market, etc. I am a member of the student investment portfolio at Umaine and my job is to analyze the earnings of companies and when companies IPO. Other then that I am a pretty chill person, love fishing, sports, and hanging out with family and friends...</p>
