<h1>Oreo and Fenway!</h1>

</head>
<body>

<p><i>Hi guys</i>, my final page is going to be about my dogs. I have two dogs, one is a yourkey poo and the other one is a yourkey beshon. My dogs names are Fenway and Oreo, Oreo is the oldest at 13 and Fenway is at 6 years old. Fenway is the wild one, he is very playful sometimes too playful and may accidentally naw on your hand but he means well. Oreo loves to relax, and mainly he sticks to my mom or aunt susan whenever they are around and only lets them pick him up. My dogs are amazing though and I would not trade them for anything in the world, they have become my best friends over the years and it is the best thing I could ever ask for...</p>
