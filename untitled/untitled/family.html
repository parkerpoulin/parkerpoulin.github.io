    <p><i>Hi guys</i>, in this page I am going to talk a little about my family. I am apart of a family of 5 with two siblings. My two siblings are girls and for age I am stuck in the middle between both of them. My father has a huge family as he was apart of a family of 11 children, now that time has gone on my family is starting to gain many little children and attending alot more weddings. My mom's side of the family is not very big, she has two sisters and I really am only close with one of her sisters and actually that one I am close with is like my second mother...</p>
