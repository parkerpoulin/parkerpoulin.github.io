    <p>Hi guys</i>, this page is going to be about one of my favorite hobbies in fishing. There is two types of fishing, open water and ice fishing. My favorite type of fishing is ice fishing because you kind of get the best of both worlds. You can use a jig rod and stay active with that and you can also set up ice fishing traps at the same time if you wanted too and catch fish that way. When I go fishing I like to get up really early about 4:30 and head out on to the ice usually with my father or some of my friends. Some of my favorite fish to catch are white perch, trout, bass and pike; I do fish for perch and trout more so than other fish cause there a better eating fish...</p>
